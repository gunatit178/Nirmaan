 * Capability-based access control.

 * are just named bundles of capabilities, so a new role (or a changed
 * responsibility) is one edit here, not a hunt through pages and actions.
 *
 * Every server action and every page checks a capability on the server.
 * Hiding a button is a courtesy, never the control.
