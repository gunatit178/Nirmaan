/**
 * A free, deterministic heuristic that nudges the model tier for one
 * specific task instance up or down from its agent role's baseline —
 * separate from model-router.ts's TaskType routing, which reflects what
 * KIND of reasoning a role generally needs (Principal Architect always
 * needs deep reasoning; Content Strategist rarely does). This adjusts
 * around that baseline per-instance, so a genuinely trivial
 * "requirements" task doesn't always pay for Sonnet, and a genuinely
 * gnarly one doesn't get stuck on Haiku.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a second model call: spending tokens to decide how
 * many tokens to spend defeats the point for something this cheap to
 * approximate with plain string matching. If this ever needs to be
 * smarter than keyword/length matching, that's exactly what the
 * "classification" TaskType (a cheap Haiku triage call, already reserved
 * in model-router.ts) is for — a deliberate next step, not an oversight.
