/**
 * The six gated stage transitions, taken verbatim from the architecture
 * plan's Section G: "the six quality gates map onto the stage transitions
 * that actually matter (Requirements→Planning, Design→Architecture,
 * Architecture→Implementation, Implementation→QA, QA→Security Review,
 * Security Review→Deployment)."
 *
 * Every OTHER stage transition (LEAD→DISCOVERY, DISCOVERY→REQUIREMENTS,
 * ESTIMATION→PROPOSAL, etc.) has no formal quality gate in this system —
 * that's a deliberate reading of Section H, not an oversight. This module
 * only knows how to advance a project through these six transitions.
 *
 * What "enforced" means here, deliberately: a gate is satisfied when a
 * human (or reviewing agent) has recorded an explicit APPROVED Approval
 * for it — this module does not attempt to algorithmically judge whether
 * a PRD is "good enough" (that judgment call is exactly what the Approval
 * decision represents). It only refuses to advance the project's stage
 * without that recorded decision.
